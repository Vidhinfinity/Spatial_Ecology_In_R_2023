# Working on copernicus data. Discussion on copernicus site and definitions.
#Leaf Area index: half the total area of green elements of the canopy per unit horizontal ground area.
#FCOVER (Fraction of Vegetation Cover): the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation.
#FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation): the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed by live leaves for the photosynthesis activity. 
#NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: NDVI = (REF_nir â€“ REF_red)/(REF_nir + REF_red)
#Dry Matter Productivity (DMP) represents the overall growth rate or dry biomass increase of the vegetation.
#energy, watercycle and cryosphere parameters being discussed.
