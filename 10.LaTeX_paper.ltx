The Road Not Taken
by Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

\section{Introduction}

The Road Not Taken
by Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

\section{Methods}

For this thesis, a formula is used.
\begin{equation}
F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{d^2}
\label{eqNewton}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a = b + c
\label{eqsum}
\end{equation}

Starting from equation \ref{eqsum}, as we have seen in section \ref{secIntro}, and as we have seen in equation \ref{eqNewton}, so and so.

\section{Results}

When I look into my inner eyes
I see the shadow of its shadow;
When I touch my fingertips
I feel its vibrations.
The final output will look like that of Figure \ref{fighelical}.

\section{Discussion}

The results found in this thesis are in line with previous experiments.

The main achievements of this thesis can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphical representation of species distributions
    \item Statistical analysis of uncertainty
    \item Literature on theme
\end{itemize}

We might also make use of numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Graphical representation of species distributions
    \item Statistical analysis of uncertainty
    \item Literature on theme
\end{enumerate}
